# mentalHealthChatbot
The Mental Health Chatbot uses Python and GPT-2 to simulate empathetic conversations. Fine-tuned on a mental health dataset, it generates supportive replies and is built in Jupyter Notebook. Ideal for learning and prototyping, it's not a substitute for professional mental health care.
