🧠 Mental Health Chatbot – README
📘 Project Description
This project is a mental health support chatbot that uses a basic deep learning model to recognize user intent and provide appropriate, empathetic responses. It is built using TensorFlow/Keras, and trained on a custom dataset of mental health-related questions and concerns.

The chatbot is designed to help users express their feelings and receive supportive feedback, information, and motivation. It doesn't replace professional mental health services, but it serves as a compassionate first contact for people looking to talk about anxiety, depression, stress, or general well-being.

💡 Key Features
🌱 Custom-trained LSTM model for intent classification

🧾 Intent-based dataset using JSON format with patterns and responses

🤖 Real-time interaction in a terminal-based chat format

🧠 Preprocessing with tokenization and label encoding

📚 Built using TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, and Scikit-learn

🛠️ Trainable and extendable with new intents and patterns

🧪 Dataset (mental-health.json)
The dataset is structured around intents, each with a tag, a list of patterns (user inputs), and responses (chatbot replies). Example:

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "anxiety",
      "patterns": ["I feel anxious", "I'm nervous all the time"],
      "responses": ["It’s okay to feel anxious sometimes. Would you like to talk about what’s causing it?"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
🔧 How It Works
Data Loading & Preprocessing:

Patterns and tags are extracted from the JSON.

Tags are encoded using LabelEncoder.

Patterns are tokenized and converted into padded sequences.

Model Architecture:

Embedding layer to convert words into vector representations.

Bidirectional LSTM to capture context from both directions.

Dense layers with ReLU and softmax for classification.

Training:

The model is trained using categorical crossentropy loss.

epochs=100 ensures enough exposure for learning.

Chat Interface:

Runs a while loop in the terminal.

Classifies user input and responds with a randomly selected message from the relevant intent.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo or upload files to Google Colab or your local environment.

Ensure you have the following dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas nltk tensorflow scikit-learn
Download required NLTK data:

python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
Open the notebook mental_health_chatbot.ipynb and run all cells.

At the end, use the chat() function in the notebook or terminal to talk to the bot.

📈 Example Conversation
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Chatbot is ready! hello,tell me how you are feeling.
You: I'm feeling really stressed lately
Chatbot: It’s okay to feel stressed. Can you share what’s been overwhelming you?

You: I feel alone.
Chatbot: You're not alone in this. Talking about it can help. I'm here for you.

You: quit
🔍 Limitations
Responses are rule-based per intent, so not fully conversational like GPT.

Not capable of deep contextual understanding or follow-up reasoning.

Should not be used as a replacement for clinical help.
